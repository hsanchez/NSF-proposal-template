% When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:
%
% Intellectual Merit: The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and
% Broader Impacts: The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.
% The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:
%
% What is the potential for the proposed activity to
% Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and
% Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?
% To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?
% Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?
% How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?
% Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?
% Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.
% Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria
% Reviewers will be asked to:
% Comment on the extent to which the project scope identifies compelling and innovative research problem(s) responsive to FW-HTF, including the potential for contribution toward (a) transforming the frontiers of science and technology for human performance augmentation and workplace skill acquisition; (b) improving both worker quality of life and employer financial metrics; (c) enhancing the economic and social well-being of the country; and (d) addressing societal needs through research on learning and instruction in the context of augmentation.
% Comment on the collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research and the Collaboration Plan proposed.

% ========== Solicitation-Specific Information ==========
% Future of Work Focus: New convergent research...
% to understand and develop the human-technology partnership,
% to design new technologies to augment human performance,
% to illuminate the emerging socio-technological landscape, and
% to foster lifelong and pervasive learning with technology.
%
% Projects should be framed in terms of the potential contribution toward
% (a) transforming the frontiers of science and technology for human performance augmentation and workplace skill acquisition;
% (b) improving both worker quality of life and employer financial metrics;
% (c) enhancing the economic and social well-being of the country; and
% (d) addressing societal needs through research on learning and instruction in the context of augmentation
% Travel: One PI from each institute per PI meeting (yearly)
% ========================================================

% (d) Description (15 pages)
% Fully describe the relevance of the project to the goals of NSF's FW-HTF Big Idea. In this regard, PIs must frame the proposed research in terms of the potential contribution toward (a) transforming the frontiers of science and technology for human performance augmentation and workplace skill acquisition; (b) improving both worker quality of life and employer financial metrics; (c) enhancing the economic and social well-being of the country; and (d) addressing societal needs through research on learning and instruction in the context of augmentation.
% Outline specific research questions, hypotheses, and gaps in science, engineering, and/or education knowledge responsive to FW-HTF Theme 1 or 2.
% Describe the vision of success for the proposal â€” specifically defining the project goals and the definition of a successful outcome.
