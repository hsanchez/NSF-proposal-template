% provide a detailed approach for the creation of new knowledge through the rigorous integration of disciplinary knowledge spanning disparate engineering and scientific disciplines. The plan should list the key disciplines needed to achieve the objectives of the proposed research, explain the role of each and why it is necessary, identify the PI or Co-PIs who represent one or more disciplines as experts, outline the approach to the integration and management of these disciplines/experts, and suggest the advances in knowledge that their integration will yield. If a Project Manager is proposed, her or his activities in the project must be described in the Collaboration Plan.
